## Description
Kanaka is a single-player video game designed to help beginners learn the Japanese language. 

Players aim to catch specific kana falling from the top of their display by controlling a bucket which moves left-to-right. The specific kana they must catch, which changes over time, is announced only by sound/voice to promote listening skills.
 
The game ends when a player catches the wrong kana, or if the player misses 4 requested kana over the course of the game. After making a mistake, the player is given the correct answer in order to utilize the hypercorrection effect.

The player’s goal is to play for as long as they possibly can.
